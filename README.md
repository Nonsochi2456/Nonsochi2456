ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Prince Chidera Kingsley, a passionate Computer Science student at the University of South Wales.

ðŸ’» I love diving into the world of coding and design, where I enjoy creating innovative solutions and beautiful user experiences. Whether it's building web applications or exploring new programming languages, I'm always eager to learn and grow.

ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not coding, you can find me sketching out design ideas or experimenting with new technologies. I believe that great software combines both functionality and aesthetics.

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring:

Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
c++ and c#
Python 
ðŸ“« Let's connect! I'm always open to collaboration and new ideas. Feel free to reach out!
